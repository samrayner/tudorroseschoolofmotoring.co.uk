	<p>Lessons are structured and conducted on a one&ndash;to&ndash;one basis in a relaxed and friendly manner and are designed to include all of the &lsquo;core competencies&rsquo; required by the <a href="http://www.dsa.gov.uk/">Driving Standards Agency</a> in order that you can reach the required standard in the shortest possible time. They can be arranged for any duration to suit you.</p>

	<p>Typical duration of lessons are one hour, one and a half hours or two hour sessions, but this can be adapted to your own personal needs. I also teach in the evenings and at weekends.</p>

	<p><abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr> research suggests that the average number of lessons necessary for a pupil to reach the required standard to enable them to take their test is in the region of 45 hours. Of course, this is just an average and is dependent upon the individual. Progress will be monitored closely throughout your course of learning and tailored accordingly.</p>

	<div id="theory">

	<h3>The Theory Test</h3>
	<p>Before a booking can be made for a practical test you must first pass your theory test which is split into two sections. The first is the multiple choice section. As of September 2007 you are required to answer fifty questions, of which forty three must be answered correctly.</p>

<p>The second section, the hazard perception test, relies heavily on your ability to anticipate the ever changing road situation and consists of fourteen video clips each of which contain at least one &lsquo;developing&rsquo; hazard. However, one of these clips will contain a second developing hazard. The earlier you identify these hazards the higher you will score. To pass, you must score at least forty four out of a possible seventy five. It should be noted that you must pass both sections in order to gain your theory test certificate.</p>

	</div>

	<div id="mocks">

	<h3>Mock Tests</h3>
	<p>During your practical driving test you will have the <abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr> examiner sitting next to you recording all of your driving errors, which can be somewhat intimidating. Whilst committing a maximum of fifteen driver errors is still acceptable for you to pass your test, just one error recorded as either serious or dangerous will result in an unsuccessful conclusion to your test.</p>

	<p>Therefore, as you approach test standard, I will be happy to conduct mock tests with you so you can acclimatise yourself for the big day, making you more prepared and helping you to relax during the real test.</p>

	<div id="passplus">

	<h3>Pass Plus</h3>
	<p>I am a <a href="http://www.passplus.org.uk/">Pass Plus</a> registered instructor. Pass Plus is an additional course of tuition available during the twelve months after you have passed your practical driving test.</p>

	<p>It is keenly encouraged by the <abbr title="Driving Standards Agency">DSA</abbr> and many insurance companies. It is designed not only to enhance your range of driving skills but can also considerably reduce your insurance premium. In addition, the cost of Pass Plus should easily be repaid by the reduction in that premium.</p>

	<p>It consists of a minimum of six hours tuition covering a variety of topics which include town driving, all weather driving, out of town driving and rural roads, night driving, fast dual carriageway driving and motorway driving.</p>

	</div>

	<div id="night">

	<h3>Night Driving</h3>
	<p>Driving at night is quite different to driving during the day for many reasons but particularly when it involves judging speeds and distances in the dark. I can offer structured lessons at night to build your confidence after you have passed your test.</p>

	</div>

	<div id="motorway">

	<h3>Motorway Tuition</h3>
	<p>To complement your new driving skills once you have passed your test, I can provide motorway tuition. This will enhance your skills and give you greater confidence on today&rsquo;s busy motorways.</p>

	</div>

	<div id="refresher">

	<h3>Refresher Course</h3>
	<p>Following a period of absence from driving even the experienced driver can lose confidence. I offer a refresher course which will get you back up to speed and restore your confidence. An initial informal assessment lesson will help to identify where we need to start.</p>
